# NoteBoard

## Descrition: ##
My head can be chaotic at times... so I created a messageboard with sticky-notes. Now I can write short reminders for myself.

See it in action here:

## Techniques used: ##
JS: React.js, CSS, Emotion.js

## What I learned from this project: ##
* more practice with a React-project of my own
* more practice with skeuomorphic styling in CSS
* which I later refactored to CSS-in-JS, using Emotion.js
* using localStorage, and JSON to extract and save the data
